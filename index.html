  <h1>7 Principles to Improve Productivity</h1>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Set a Daily Main Goal:</strong> Start each day by defining one clear primary objective.</li>
    <li><strong>Break Down Large Tasks:</strong> Divide big projects into smaller, focused subtasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Work in Short Sessions:</strong> Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work + 5 minutes break).</li>
    <li><strong>Minimize Distractions:</strong> Turn off notifications, close unnecessary tabs, and keep your workspace tidy.</li>
    <li><strong>Apply the 80/20 Rule:</strong> Focus on the few tasks that generate most of the results.</li>
    <li><strong>Daily Review:</strong> At the end of the day, review what was accomplished and plan for tomorrow.</li>
    <li><strong>Take Breaks and Move:</strong> Every hour, take a short break â€” stretch, walk, or drink water.</li>
