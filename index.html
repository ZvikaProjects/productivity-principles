  <h2>Additional Productivity Tips</h2>

  <p>Effective time management starts with setting clear priorities and understanding which tasks will bring the greatest impact. Avoid multitasking whenever possible, as it often reduces focus and leads to lower quality outcomes. Instead, dedicate uninterrupted time blocks to your most important projects. Maintaining a clean and organized workspace can also reduce cognitive load and improve concentration.</p>
